## About The Project

This repository contains the refactored code for Horiseon Services website with additional elements for people with slow internet connections or for people with disabilities. People with disabilities can now access Horiseon's website with functions that allow screen-readers to indicate where the user is located with alternative text for images and tooltips for links. For search engine optimization, the website will now place better within the search queries due to proper element optimization and timeline of importance due to the added feature.

Additionally, I ran into issues within the code for the index.html and style.css, so I changed and improved the codebase and functionality of the website. The links within the navigation bar were not functioning, but now they will take the user to the designated spot within the website using img id's. The source code has been optimized with the removal of non-semantic elements. You will now find that semantic HTML elements are being used and are positioned in order of importance. A title to the page has also been added so that it reads "Horiseon Homepage" to indicate that the user is on the homepage of Horiseon Services. Overall, this code is now more efficient and the website will be more accessible in the long-term.
